            <p>Hi there, welcome to my digital space! </p>
            <p>I'm <span className='header__description_name'>Khanh Vo</span>, a passionate <span className='header__description_role'>computer science</span> and <span className='header__description_role'>geographical information systems graduate</span> from <span className='header__description_uni'>University of Toronto, where my academic journey has been a fusion of coding and spatial exploration.</span>.</p>
            <p>This website serves as a digital canvas where I'll share insights, experiences, and the fruits of my GIS and CS endeavors. I want this space to be more than a portfolioâ€”it's a conversation. A dialogue about the endless possibilities at the intersection of GIS and computer science.</p>
